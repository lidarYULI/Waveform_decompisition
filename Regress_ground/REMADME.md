This is a new trial to identify ground return location based on regression method;

I would like to classify waveform itself firstly because I think different waveforms should be 
predicted for ground return by different regression models.

The waveform classification will be implemented by Gaussian Mixture Model, it is soft classification method;
The number of classification will be automatically determined by GMM;
